JSX 
=> is not HTML inside JS
=> HTML or XML like syntax
=> JS engine does not understand JSX syntax
=> It is a syntax extension for JavaScript, recommended by React, that allows you to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript code. Although primarily associated with React, JSX can be used with other libraries too. It combines the power of JavaScript with the familiarity of HTML, enabling developers to create UI components with a declarative syntax.
=> attributes in JSX are written in camelCase
=> wrap JSX with () if you need to write JSX in multiple lines

Parcel vs Vite vs Webpack
Parcel, Vite, and Webpack are all popular tools used in modern web development for bundling files, transforming code, and optimizing applications.

=> Webpack is best for large, complex applications where you need granular control over the build process.
=> Parcel offers a great developer experience with zero configuration, making it ideal for smaller projects or for developers who prioritize ease of use.
=> Vite combines the best of both worlds with its fast development server and optimized production builds, suitable for modern web applications that use components and ES modules.

Babel
=> Babel is a critical tool/compiler in modern web development, enabling developers to use tomorrowâ€™s JavaScript language features today. It ensures that applications are compatible across different browsers and environments, making web development more about innovation and less about dealing with discrepancies in platform capabilities.
=> Converts JSX code into React.createElement so that React can understand the code
=> Parcel transpiles the JSX code before it reaches the JS Engine

Types of components
=> Class based components - old
	 Class components are more traditional React components that are defined using ES6 classes. 
=> Function based components - new
	 Functional components are JavaScript functions that return React elements.
